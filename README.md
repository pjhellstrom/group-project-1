# Group Do: Designing your MVP

## Instructions
* With your group, answer each of the following questions:
  1. Who is your target audience?
  <!-- people who don't know how to cook -->
  2. What is the problem that the product will address?
  <!-- it's hard to get a customized recepie -->
  3. What is the primary goal of the product?
  <!-- is to get healthy recepies -->
  4. Identify and prioritize essential user stories (limit this to 3 or fewer)?
  <!-- As a user, I want a smiple way to get a recepies i like.
       As a user, I don't want to eat junck food.
       As a user, I want to track my neutrition value.
   -->

* Remember, your MVP should be the absolute *minimum* product that you need to pitch your idea to investors (or your classmates). Think bare essentials.

* As an example, the essential features of an instagram-like application might look like:

  1. As a user, I want to post pictures so that I can share my life.
  2. As a user, I want to be able to search for other users so that I can find their list of images.
  3. As a user, I want to be able to view other people's images so that I can keep up with what's happening in their lives. 
    Cooking novices who need recipes for inspiration.

  2. What is the problem that the product will address?

  There is no app with a simple GUI that provides customized recipes for occasional cooks.


  3. What is the primary goal of the product?
    To get recipes


  4. Identify and prioritize essential user stories (limit this to 3 or fewer)?
  
  1. As a user, I want a simple user friendly way to get meal inspiration and recipes
  2. As a user, I want an easy way to find recipies for ingredients that I have on hand
  3. As a user, I want to find recipes like to know the nutritional value of what I'm eating
  

* Remember, your MVP should be the absolute *minimum* product that you need to pitch your idea to investors (or your classmates). Think bare essentials. 

* Things like liking photos, sending photos to friends, making instagram stories, etc are cool, but they aren't essential. They should **not** be part of the MVP.
