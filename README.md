# Group Do: Designing your MVP

## Instructions
* With your group, answer each of the following questions:
  1. Who is your target audience?
    Cooking novices who need recipes for inspiration.

  2. What is the problem that the product will address?

  There is no app with a simple GUI that provides customized recipes for occasional cooks.


  3. What is the primary goal of the product?
    To get recipes


  4. Identify and prioritize essential user stories (limit this to 3 or fewer)?
  
  1. As a user, I want a simple user friendly way to get meal inspiration and recipes
  2. As a user, I want an easy way to find recipies for ingredients that I have on hand
  3. As a user, I want to find recipes like to know the nutritional value of what I'm eating
  

* Remember, your MVP should be the absolute *minimum* product that you need to pitch your idea to investors (or your classmates). Think bare essentials. 

* Things like liking photos, sending photos to friends, making instagram stories, etc are cool, but they aren't essential. They should **not** be part of the MVP.
